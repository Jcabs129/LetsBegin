#Using this I want you to type each of these lines of Ruby code into irb and see what it does:

module Ex25


#'Require' is to retrieve a specific file stated "./ex25.rb"
require "./ex25.rb"

#the output is made into a sentence "All good things come to those who wait."
sentence = "All good things come to those who wait."

#this line beak the words in to single quotes e.g. "All" "good" "things"
words = Ex25.break_words(sentence)

#will print out every word (singular) within the sentence
words

#This specific variable 'sort_words' arranges the words within the sentence alphabetically
sorted_words = Ex25.sort_words(words)

#Display the value of sorted_words
sorted_words

#This specific syntax prints out the first word within the sentence
Ex25.print_first_word(words)

#This specific syntax prints out the last word within the sentence
Ex25.print_last_word(words)

words

#prints out the first word in the sentence
Ex25.print_first_word(sorted_words)

#prints out the last word of the sentence
Ex25.print_last_word(sorted_words)

#this variable when run will print out all the words alphabetically apart from "All" and "who"? why?

sorted_words


sorted_words = Ex25.sort_sentence(sentence)
sorted_words

# call the print_first_and_last function on the sentence
# a copy of the sentence is created for the function
# the sentence is broken up into word, and
# the first and last words are printed
Ex25.print_first_and_last(sentence)

# call the print_first_and_last function on the sentence
# a copy of the sentence is split up into words,
# the words are sorted, then the first and last words are printed
Ex25.print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence)
