=begin
The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you can't, skip it and come back later.

For this exercise, try these things:

1) Make your script print another line.
2) Make your script print only one of the lines.
3) Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
=end

#puts "Hello World!"
#puts"Hello Again"
#puts "I like typing this."
#puts "This is fun!"
puts "Yay! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
#puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
