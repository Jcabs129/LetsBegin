# Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
#This puts comment represents a variable that has a string output, however notice the '\n' before the words, this will make a new line  
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMarch\nApr\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust"

puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

puts %q{
  There's something going on Here.
  With the three double-quotes.
  We'll be able to tpye as much as we like.
  Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
